***Table 3 caption:***\
  Quantitative evaluation results of the inter-patient (i.e., the JHU dataset) and the atlas-to-patient (i.e., the IXI dataset) brain MRI registration (left table), and XCAT-to-CAT registration (right table). Dice score and percentage of voxels with a non-positive Jacobian determinant (i.e., folded voxels) are evaluated for different methods. The bolded numbers denote the highest scores, while the italicized ones indicate the second highest.

***Table 6 caption:***\
System-level comparison of various TransMorph designs and the customized VoxelMorph on the test datasets of inter-patient MRI and XCAT-to-CT registration tasks. ‘‘Val. DSC’’ denotes the Dice scores on the validation dataset; ‘‘Test DSC’’ denotes the system-level comparison of the Dice scores on the test dataset. The bolded numbers denote the highest scores, while the italicized ones indicate the second highest.
